## How to Ask Questions

### Natural Language
You can ask questions just like you would ask a person:

**Good Examples:**
- "What's our average possession this season?"
- "Show me games where we scored more than 3 goals"
- "Compare our shots for and against in home vs away games"
- "What's our win rate against [opponent name]?"
- "Which games did we have the highest xG?"

**Less Effective:**
- Single words or very short queries
- Questions about data not in the system
- Questions unrelated to match data

### Be Specific
- Mention the team if you have multiple teams
- Specify time periods if relevant
- Include opponent names if asking about specific matchups

## Types of Questions

### Statistical Questions
Ask about averages, totals, trends:
- "What's our average goals per game?"
- "How many shots did we take in October?"
- "What's our possession percentage this season?"

### Comparison Questions
Compare different aspects:
- "Compare our home and away performance"
- "How do we perform against top teams vs bottom teams?"
- "Compare first half vs second half possession"

### Trend Questions
Ask about changes over time:
- "Are we improving in shots this season?"
- "How has our conversion rate changed?"
- "Show me our goal scoring trend"

### Specific Match Questions
Ask about individual games:
- "What happened in the game against [opponent] on [date]?"
- "Which game had the most shots?"
- "Show me details from our last match"

## Understanding Responses

- If data hasn't been entered, it can't answer
- Some metrics may not be available for all matches

### Complex Analysis

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Basic Statistics
**You:** "What's our average goals per game this season?"

**AI:** "Your team is averaging 2.3 goals per game this season across 15 matches. You've scored a total of 35 goals."

**You:** "How does that compare to last season?"

**AI:** "Last season you averaged 1.8 goals per game, so you're scoring 0.5 more goals per game this season - a 28% increase!"

### Example 2: Comparison
**You:** "Compare our home and away performance"

**AI:** "Here's how your team performs at home vs away:

**Home Games (8 matches):**
- Average Goals: 2.6
- Average Possession: 58%
- Win Rate: 75%

**Away Games (7 matches):**
- Average Goals: 1.9
- Average Possession: 52%
- Win Rate: 57%

You perform significantly better at home, with higher goals, possession, and win rate."

### Example 3: Specific Match
**You:** "What happened in the game against Arsenal on October 15th?"

**AI:** "In your match against Arsenal on October 15, 2024:

- Result: 3-1 Win
- Goals: 3 (you) vs 1 (Arsenal)
- Shots: 18 (you) vs 12 (Arsenal)
- Possession: 62% (you) vs 38% (Arsenal)
- xG: 2.8 (you) vs 1.2 (Arsenal)

You dominated possession and created more chances, resulting in a convincing win."
